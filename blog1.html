        <h3>What is representation?</h3>
        <p> The concept of representation according to Kidd(2015) is concerned with the production of meaning about the ideas that exist in our minds; 
            these ideas are shaped by our experiences in the world, culture. </p>
     
    
  
    <p>There are two systems of representation, the first being the conceptual map that we all have; this is how we link certain signs to certain objects or how we link certain signs to have certain meanings, 
        the meaning of course depends on the system of ideas and images that we carry in our heads. It depends on our experiences in the world and our relationship with objects or things in general in the real world.</p>
    
    <p>The second system is the language system, this system depends on the relationship between ideas, 
        things and signs to produce meaning.</p>
         <p>Representation is everywhere, and we have learnt about the importance of representation, 
             it plays a huge role in how we make meaning and experience the world . 
             For example, some years ago, the lack of representation of ‘the other’ in the media came off as though the people that belong to ‘the other’ groups were not part of the world or as though they are not good enough; 
             like the represented group was the standard and everyone who did not fit in that box was not good enough.  </p>
        <p>In recent times, the lack of representation is not the issue, however, the manner in which certain groups or certain things are represented can be problematic especially in the media and even on the web.
             Misrepresentations are just as bad as the lack of representation if not worse, 
            because it misleads people and it has long lasting effects, it can also create fear.</p>
