        <h2>Reflection of  ethics in data visualisation</h2>
        <figure class = "risk"><img src="best-data-visualizations-2019-1-Codex-Atlanticus.gif" alt="" width="100%"></figure>
        
    <p> Data visualisation, also known as infographics, is the process of taking in raw data, patterns, big data , 
        trends and representing or translating them into the visual representations; they can be translated into graphs or maps to make it easier for people to comprehend the data.
         Data visualisation can be considered as as a form of visual art,
         it is meant to attract users’ attention, not only that, it can also educate or provide knowledge to the user about something. </p>
 
   
    
    <p>The main purpose of visual data is to make it easier to identify trends patterns and outliers in large data sets and to make information/ data easier to understand for humans.
         And that is why the developers use signs or more specifically common signifiers that are part of our everyday culture in their graphic representations of the data. 
         In my analysis of the <a href= “blog3.html”>coronavirus riskiest activities</a> graph,
         I highlight how the developers  represented the signifier red as a colour that connotes higher/highest risk activities. </p>

    <p>Data visualisation is about data exploration and communication, it is about thinking about your audience or users and how you can clearly communicate this data
         to them in a way that is not only educational but also aesthetically pleasing, because aesthetics interest people; It is also about storytelling.</p>

         <p>Why is data visualisation so important? Because it saves people time, and  the information on an infographic is easy to understand. Companies, brands, or marketing people also use it because it helps them identify the consumer behaviour, 
             and it helps them understand trends and pinpoint where they need to focus on more to improve sales or their business. </p>

         <p>Data visualisation is not only good though, it has its downside; it can be used to bend the truth and misinterpret information. 
             In other cases brands or companies will choose to build  a one sided data viz, a successive graph for example so that people get the impression that the brand is doing well to attract more traffic  to their brand. 
             This process of choosing one side of data to represent is known as data viz manipulation, and it is mostly used in politics.</p>

         <p>This misinformation and misleading of people is what is unethical in data visualisation.</p>
