        <h3> Reflection On Exam Visualisation</h3>

        <p>The requirement for this task was to create an infographic that is interactive, and that communicates or interrogates data about covid-19. For this task, I produced an infographic, using the same data that I had used for my previous charts; and the reason for this is because I wanted to see just how much variations of infographics I could produce using the same, arguably simple data. </p>
        <p>I made my visual data using a library called d3.js; this a library that was developed by a data visualisation specialist named Michael Bostock, and it is used for making interactive  and very nice infographics and it cuts down the amount of coding that one would have to do to create data visualisations. </p>

        <p>The goal was to challenge myself to see if I could make simple data look interesting; as you may have read on my previous blogs, I defined infographics as a the process of taking complex big data and making it easier for users to read and comprehend. I have also mentioned that data visualisation is also is a type of art; now in my visualisation, I have attempted (and maybe even failed) to create ‘art’ using simple data. Now, did I manage to create interesting aesthetically pleasing charts, absolutely not, but I did learn a lot in the process. </p>
        <p>The aim going into this final project was to create a bar chart that was animated in 3d using JavaScript; this was supposed to add on to the interactivity, and also to make the simple data look really cool.  I had previously animated a card in 3d using JavaScript, and so I thought that animating a bar graph would be just as easy but unfortunately for me, it was not. </p>
        <p>I did manage to create a chart which when you click on the checkpoint lines up to create a linear bar graph which represents the common symptoms of covid-19. To represent the commonness of a symptom I used size and colour; the highest bars represent symptoms that are most common, while the lowest ones represent the least common ones. The more saturated colours represent the most common symptoms while the less saturated represent the least common ones. </p>
        <p>I would not say that my visual representations of the data were the best or the most meaningful, however, I would argue that I did challenge myself and I think I did Okay .</p>
