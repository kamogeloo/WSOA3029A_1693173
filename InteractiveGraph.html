        <h3>Critical reflection on Interactive Graph </h3>

        <p>Interactive data visualisation “refers to the modern use of data analysis software that enables users to directly manipulate and explore graphical representations of data (omni-sci, 2020).
             Data visualisation helps users to clearly understand the importance of data, and interactive data  improves on the concept of data visualisation by “incorporating tools that facilitate the modification
              of the parameters of a data visualisation” (omni-sci, 2020) .The graphical elements in a data visualisation are often animated and provide instant feedback when a user inputs or hovers over them. <p>
            <p> The benefits of interactive data visualisation are that users can identify trends faster and relationships between data more effectively.
                 Interactive data is a useful for storytelling, it aids in making complex data easy to understand, and it keeps users engaged and even captures their interest. </p>
            <p> In my opinion, interactive data visualisation is best suited for data that is very complex, and also for big data; static data visualisations on the other hand are best used for data that is less complex</p>
            <p> In my attempt of interactive data visualisation, I chose to use non-complex data, the reason for this decision is because I wanted to first familiarise myself with this concept, 
                to first learn the technical skills of creating this type of data visualisation.</p> 
            <p> I used the same data that I used in my two static data visualisations, which was the information on the common symptoms of Coronavirus. 
                I used colour to represent the commonality; I used saturation to represent commonality, the squares that are more saturated e.g the red square, 
                represents the most common symptom of covid-19 and the yellow square represents the least common symptom. The reason behind the use of these signifiers is because they are common, people know that the colour red connotes danger and the colour yellow connotes optimism or happiness.</p>
             I also used squares to represent different symptoms. 
             The squares are differently scaled, the biggest represent the most common symptoms and small circles represent the least common symptoms, this is another common signifier, .
              The interactive that I currently have in my visualisation is that when the user hovers over the squares they scale up and then scale down when the user is no longer hovering over them. 
            More interaction will be added in the next iteration, and maybe even the data used might change</p>
