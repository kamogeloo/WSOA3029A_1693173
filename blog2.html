        <h3>Case Study : Coronavirus Riskiest Activities</h3>
        <p> In this blog post I will be analysing a graph/piece of visual data from the site, <strong><i><a href= " https://informationisbeautiful.net/">Information is beautiful.</a></i> </strong>
        The case study that I will be looking at is titled <i>Coronavirus Riskiest Activities</i> , 
        I will be looking at a graph that shows different activities that people can do or used to do and whether or not those activities are considered high, medium or low risk
        The data used for this graph is according to the site is information that was collected from different professionals,this is inclusive of epidemiologists and health workers.</p>
 
    <h3>Representation/ Communication</h3>
    <figure class = "risk"><img src="Coronavirus-COVID19-riskiest-activities-03.png" alt="Graph representing risky activities" width="100%"></figure>
    <figcaption><i> A Graph Representing Riskiest Activities during a the Covid-19 pandemic</i></figcaption>
    <p>This graph has three parts/sections, these sections contain a group of low, medium and high risk activities. </p>
    <p>In this graph, the activities are represented by different coloured and different sized circles. Low risk activities are represented by a yellow colour, the smaller less saturated circles represent activities with the lowest risk;
         while the more saturated ones represent activities that are more riskier than the ones with less saturation. And the activities that are the most riskiest activities are represented by a red color, the color red is culturally known as the color of danger
        or romance, its meaning is of course not fixed, its meaning depends on the context; and since this graph is about risk, i think its safe to assume that red means danger.</p>
         <p>An important thing to note is the fact that that they do mention the conditions of keeping those low risk activities low risk, some reasoning as to why some activities are considered high risk is also included. This is important because it shows that they are not trying to decieve or mislead people, which means that they are aware of the power of visual data</p>
         <p>They also used sizes to communicate risk; the smaller circles in each section communicate activities that are less risky, and the big ones communicate more risk. </p>
         <p>Lastly, they used height to communicate risk, the least risky activities in each section are at the bottom and the most risky are at the top</p>
         <p>The purpose of visual data is to make data/big data easier to read and understand for people, and I feel like this graph is a perfect example of how visual data is supposed to be.</p>
